# applications_2023
Submit your applications as a git submodule to this repository.

Above you'll be able to see Sample_Submission. Your folder after the pull request is accepted should also look like that (note that your repo should be private, the sample one is not). You will be able to click it, that is, it should be seen as a folder, and it should take you to your repository. If it doesn't do so, it means that you have not configured it properly.
Make sure you upload ```alias.txt``` with your alias name too.
